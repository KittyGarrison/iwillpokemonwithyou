      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>Inspired by the I'll Go With You (http://www.illgowithyou.org/), #IWillPokemoWithYou is a way to help Pokemon Go players self-organize for safety and fun! Pokemon Go is a fun game and a great way to meet people, get outside, and explore your area. Unfortunately, the real world isn't always safe or accessible for everyone. #iwillpokemonwithyou is an attempt to make sure everyone can play Pokemon Go safely.</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>If you feel comfortable accompanying someone on a Pokemon Go adventure, or if you don't feel comfortable--for whatever reason--going solo, tweet about it using #iwillpokemonwithyou(YourCity): #IWillPokemonWithYouDetroit, #IWillPokemonWithYouAtlanta, #IWillPokemonWithYouPheonix, etc. If you are going to be heading out and want to welcome someone to join you, tweet a time and Pokestop to meet at with your city's #iwillpokemonwithyou hashtag. Check #iwillpokemonwithyou to see if anyone nearby can help!</p>
      <h3>Who is this for? </h3>
      <p>Anyone who doesn't feel comfortable playing Pokemon Go in a particular area on their own, for any reason. Maybe a player doesn't want to walk alone through an unfamiliar neighborhood. Maybe players of color are worried about being considered "suspicious" while walking around with their phones out. Maybe players with mobility issues can't reach certain Pokestops or need some help "walking" their eggs. Or maybe players want to make some new friends and help ensure no one wanders into traffic while chasing Pokemon!</p>
      <p>#iwillpokemonwithyou is meant to be a simple, self-organizing solution to make sure everyone can play Pokemon Go safely and fully. If you have any questions, tweet @northofnormal, @anoddhue, or @Kitty_Garrison!</p>
